# Data-Dive
"A repository for exploring and analyzing data using various techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and pattern recognition, aimed at uncovering insights and supporting decision-making."

## Description
DataDive is a project focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights from datasets. This repository includes data cleaning, visualization, and pattern recognition techniques aimed at supporting decision-making by uncovering key trends and patterns within the data.

## Features
- Data cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
- Visualizations: Generating graphs and plots to visualize trends, outliers, and distributions.
- Pattern recognition: Identifying relationships and key metrics within datasets.
- Trend analysis: Highlighting changes over time and across categories.

## SQL File: 2 EDA project.sql
The SQL file contains a series of queries used for data exploration and processing in the database. The queries perform the following tasks:

- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing or null values, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Data Transformation: Aggregating, filtering, and grouping data to identify trends, outliers, and key metrics.
- Exploratory Analysis: Initial summaries of the data, including calculations of averages, sums, and distributions.

## Learnings from the Project
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Writing optimized SQL queries for data cleaning and transformation.
- Exploring datasets to identify hidden patterns and actionable insights.
- Understanding the significance of structured querying as part of the EDA process.
- Improving data handling and manipulation skills to prepare datasets for further analysis or modeling.
